## Executive Summary

Based on modern HR management best practices and the existing myFinance system capabilities, here are researched enhancements that would transform the Employee Settings page from a basic salary management tool into a comprehensive employee management system.

- **Shift Swap Requests**: Built-in system for employees to trade shifts
- **Overtime Tracking**: Automatic calculation based on shift data
- **Schedule Templates**: Save and reuse common shift patterns

### Database Tables Used:
- `store_shifts` - Available shift patterns
- `shift_requests` - Employee shift assignments
- `shift_edit_logs` - Track all changes

## 2. Performance & KPI Tracking 📊

### Why This Matters
Link employee performance directly to business metrics for data-driven decisions.

### Enhanced Features:
- **Sales Performance** (for sales staff):

  - Attendance rate percentage
  - Unplanned absence tracking
  
- **Productivity Indicators**:

  - Store performance contribution
